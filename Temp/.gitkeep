# Temp Directory

This directory contains temporary files created during VMTags execution.

## Temporary File Types:

### Execution Temp Files:
- MainScript_[ExecutionID]_stdout.txt - PowerShell process stdout capture
- MainScript_[ExecutionID]_stderr.txt - PowerShell process stderr capture
- Progress_[ExecutionID]_*.tmp - Temporary progress tracking files

### VMTags 2.1 Parallel Processing Temp Files:  
- Thread_[ThreadID]_[Timestamp].tmp - Individual thread temporary files
- BatchProgress_[BatchID].tmp - Batch processing progress files
- ErrorRecovery_[OperationID].tmp - Error recovery state files

## Automatic Cleanup:
- Files are automatically cleaned up after successful execution
- Failed operations may leave temp files for debugging
- Launcher performs cleanup on startup

## File Lifecycle:
1. Created at operation start
2. Used during execution for inter-process communication
3. Cleaned up automatically on completion
4. Retained on failure for troubleshooting

## Security:
Temporary files are excluded from version control and contain runtime data only.
Files are cleaned up automatically to prevent accumulation of unnecessary data.
